# nodebot
An ssh bot for ssh-chat by shazow. Based off of zshbot by Sxw1212

This bot does a bunch of somewhat random things:

```
user: nodebot hello
nodebot: hello, user
```
says hello back

```
user: nodebot cat
nodebot: ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ - meow
```
pretends to be a cat

__documentation incomplete...come back later for all commands__
